**Project Title: ExpressNoteApp**

**Project Details:**
The ExpressNoteApp project involves setting up a robust Express application and transitioning it to TypeScript for enhanced code integrity. The TypeScript configuration (tsconfig) will be established, and a .gitignore file will be crafted to exclude node_modules from version control.

## Problem Description:

The primary objective of this project is to create a foundational Express application capable of executing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) utilizing an SQLite database. The endpoints will be meticulously documented and exposed using Postman for thorough testing.

In this endeavor, you will construct a fundamental CRUD system tailored to a Note Application. This application will facilitate the storage and modification of notes.

## Requirements:

**Implement Authorization and Authentication: Secure All Routes. Only Authenticated Users Can Perform the Following Actions:**

- Addition of new notes.
- Editing of existing notes.
- Deletion of notes.

**Note:**
Users without authentication are granted access to peruse the notes.

## Completion Guidelines:

To successfully complete this project, your application should demonstrate the following functionality:

- `GET` Request: Retrieve all data from the database.
- `POST` Request: Add data to the database.
- `PUT` Request: Update specific data fields using the unique id in the database.
- `DELETE` Request: Remove specific data using the corresponding id.

Through this project, you will develop expertise in building secure and efficient Express applications while mastering CRUD operations and user authentication.
